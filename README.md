# Gify
For this project I wasn't sure what to do to differentiate from others so I created a hot topic themed gify site.

I included various buttons with some examples pulled from hot topics website including suicide girls (pinup appreciation), buffy the vampire slayer (apparently still popular with scene kids) and others.

I wanted the stype to be very myscapy 90's scene/emo blog posting look.
